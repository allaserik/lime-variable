## Docker & Database Setup

This project uses Docker Compose to run a local PostgreSQL database for development.

### Start PostgreSQL with Docker Compose

1. Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) installed and running.
2. Create a `.env.development`, `.env.test`, or `.env.production` file in the `backend` directory with the following example content using the ".env.example":

```bash
  # Example for .env.development
  POSTGRES_USER=sample
  POSTGRES_PASSWORD=sample
  POSTGRES_DB=sample
  DOCKER_PORT=5431
  # For test: DOCKER_PORT=5432, for prod: DOCKER_PORT=5433 (or any free port)
```

3. install globally dotenv-cli:

```bash
pnpm add -g dotenv-cli
```

4. To start the database for a specific environment, run one of the following in the `backend` directory:

   **Development:**

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml --env-file .env.development -p lime-variable-dev up -d
```

or

```bash
pnpm docker:dev:up
```

**Test:**

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml --env-file .env.test -p lime-variable-test up -d
```

or

```bash
pnpm docker:test:up
```

**Production:**

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml --env-file .env.production -p lime-variable-prod up -d
```

or

```bash
pnpm docker:prod:up
```

This will start a PostgreSQL database on the port specified by `DOCKER_PORT` in your `.env` file, mapped to 5432 in the container.

## Quick Start (Development)

To launch both the backend and the database in development mode with a single command:

1. Make sure you have created a `.env.development` file as described above.
2. In the `backend` directory, run:

   ```bash
   pnpm docker:start:dev
   ```

This will:

- Start the PostgreSQL database using Docker Compose
- Push the latest Prisma schema to the database
- Generate the Prisma client
- Start the NestJS backend in development mode
